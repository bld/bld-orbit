#+TITLE: Generalized Sail Model in Geometric Algebra
The cross product $\hat{n} \times \hat{r}$ is turned into the tensor
product of a skew tensor of $\hat{n}$ and $\hat{r}$ as: $$\tilde{n} \cdot \hat{r}$$ where
$$
\tilde{n} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & -\hat{n}_3 & \hat{n}_2 \\
\hat{n}_3 & 0 & -\hat{n}_1 \\
-\hat{n}_2 & \hat{n}_1 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Instead, we can replace $\hat{n} \times \hat{r}$ with the geometric product
$$
\hat{n} \times \hat{r} = -I \hat{n} \wedge \hat{r}$
$$

This relation is used to calculate the component of solar force in the
plane of the sail, as:
$$
\sin{\alpha} \hat{t} = -\hat{n} \times \left( \hat{n} \times \hat{r} \right)
$$

Instead of the double cross product, we can use the projection of
$\hat{r}$ into the plane of the sail. The plane of the sail is:
$$N = \hat{n}I$$
and the projection is:
$$
\sin{\alpha} \hat{t} = \hat{r} \cdot N N^{-1}
$$
